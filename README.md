Hello, This is Aryan. 
This is my second basic project to practice and revise my newly learntCSS concepts. 
In this project, I have used CSS concepts such as combining Media Queries, CSS Display, CSS Float, etc.
Anybody who is currently learning, HTML, CSS and want to practice the concepts, then projects are the best way to do the same.

If you want to practice too, then follow the below steps:-
1. First Look at goal.png
2. According to that type your CSS and HTML code.
3. I have also uploaded images that you are going to use in the project.
4. If you were successful in achieving the goal, then its good otherwise look at my codes and solve your doubts and practice again.

NOTE: Do not use Flexbox or Grid concepts, as these were intentionally not done using them.
